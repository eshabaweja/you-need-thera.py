## Color Theory
- https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/color-theory
- red : love. energy. intensity.
- yellow : joy. intellect. attention.
- green : freshness. safety. growth.
- blue : stability. trust. serenity.
- purple : royalty. wealth. femininity.

## Typography
- serif : inspired by marble carvings; differentiate by thickest and thinnest part of font
- sans-serif : no feet; very sensible
- legible: humanist vs grotesque sans serif

## User Interface Design - Manage Attention
- bigger, bolder, squarer things
- establish heirarchy: use colors, fonts, sizes
- good layout: make things interesting
- alignment: consistency; reduce the number of alignment points
- white (empty) space injection: makes things look expensive

## User Experience
- design = aesthetic
- UX = invisible; makes things easier
- simplicity (Occam's razor)
- consistent design AND consistent functionality
- reading patterns (F-shaped/Z-shaped)
- don't use **dark patterns**: don't become evil
