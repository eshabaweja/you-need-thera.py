# REST API
- Representational State Transfer
- client-server architecture: HTTP request
- SOAP was an architectural style
- so is REST, JSON, GraphQL etc.
- "all websites across the web should have the same guiding principles for their APIs"
- HTTP request language (verbs): `get, post, put, patch, delete`
- analogous to CRUD
- RESTFUL Routing
